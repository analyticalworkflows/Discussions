# Discussions
This repository doesn't contain any files except this README.md.  That's because the purpose of this repository is to enable a "discussion board" through use of GitHub's [Issues](https://github.com/analyticalworkflows/Discussions/issues) feature.

I encourage all of you to create and reply to new threads as questions, problems, or topics that you'd like to discuss further arise.  

## Suggestions
- Before creating a new issue, be sure to search through the previously-posted issues to see if your topic's already been brought up.  
- When creating a new issue, try to give it a concise and informative title. 
- If a similar, but sufficiently different issue exists, reference it (by typing `#` before its number).
- Go ahead and tag your peers using their GitHub username (e.g., @`marknovak`) to get their attention.  
- Once your issue has been addressed, go ahead and close it. (Closed issues don't disappear and will still come up in searches.)

See [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for more on using issues in GitHub.
